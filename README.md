## Experience
### Technical manager, [Lev3l Products](lev3l.co.uk), Feb 24 - Present

### Graduate Engineer, [Altrad DESSA](www.altrad-dessa.com), Oct 22 - Feb 24
After my placement at Altrad DESSA, I was offered a permanent position fulfilling my desire for more technical structural design experience. A standout project in which I was given the responsibility of developing a series of structural calculations for a new roofing system targeted towards the events industry. I am grateful to have been given this project as it allowed me to gain a vast breadth and depth of aluminium and steel design in accordance with various European standards and British national annexes.In addition, reports and all technical information for designers was written and continues to be maintained by myself. To help me achieve these objectives I attended a technical report writing course held by the institution of mechanical engineers which taught me how to apply my existing academic knowledge to a commercial setting. This understanding also allowed me to reformat current technical calculation templates at Altrad DESSA to make them follow best practices and deliver training to my colleagues. 

Another responsibility I undertook was travelling to the United Arab Emirates and delivering a technical presentation to a group of engineers about how to analyse a temporary roof with additional training using some software packages (Dlubal RSTAB9, SkyCiv S3D, AutoCAD, SketchUp, and Twinmotion). It is an ongoing relationship building assignment to provide technical support to All Events Structures while allowing for the opportunity of additional investment opportunities for Altrad DESSA.
### Final Year Project, Sep 21 - May 22
Titled ‚ÄúCompressive behaviour of 3D printed thermoplastic polyurethane lattices for Athletic midsoles‚Äù. Learnt to research effectively and compress information. Use of Fusion 360 CAD & Ansys APDL to model and simulate additively manufactured complex geometries. Models were 3D printed in order to physically test each and contrast this with simulated results. Presented my results to a board of academic experts and answered various questions. I very much enjoyed my dissertation as it allowed me to develop my CAD abilities, apply knowledge I learnt in other modules to solving problems and achieving my project aim of finding the most suited lattice geometry for athletic midsoles.
### Computer-aided Design Technician, Daitob, Sep 21 - Apr 22
Remotely designed bespoke oak orangeries & gazebos using Fusion 360 CAD software to create concise engineering drawing for use on site and during manufacture. Accurate parts lists were created so that materials could be ordered in advance.
### Engineering You're Hired! Feb 21
Collaborated remotely with a multidisciplinary team to design a solution for electric air travel. Together my team decided to focus on the fright sector. We developed ideas for autonomous airships that work in swarms to achieve low emission transit. We translated our ideas into CAD & FEA software where we inspected our designs capability to operate during bad weather. Once our designs were complete, we presented our ideas with relevant research to a board of experts working within the sector, listened to their feedback and answered any questions.
### Global Engineering Challenge, Jan 20
Worked in a multinational multidisciplinary team to design a solution to limited water supply in Maker‚Äôs Valley, Johannesburg. Initially we identified stakeholders and researched the root of the problem. Together we recognised that the main issue was that underground water pipes would frequently leak. We developed a system that would detect leaks through measuring the flow rates at each ends of pipes. One of our objectives was to achieve a relatively cheap and easy to implement method. Separately came up with potential concepts and then discussed and developed them in our daily meetings. Each member would take turns to lead conversations and manage the professional conduct of the team.
### Team leader, Vue Entertainment, Jul 17 - Aug 19
After working for 3 months I was given the opportunity to become a Team Leader. During my time I learnt to manage a team, control stock and count money. This role included training new staff and assessing them to see if they would be a positive addition to the business.
### Bartender, Watford Football Club, Aug 18 - Apr 19
Prepared food, cocktails and handled money whilst meeting all health and safety standards.

## Skills
### Leadership & Teamwork
As a member of the Sheffield Swimming and Water Polo Club, I regularly play sports together with a multinational team.
Occasionally organised training sessions when our captains were absent and took on support roles not only as a partner but as a friend. Attended fund-raisers for many charities throughout the years including Mind, Teenage Cancer Trust and Movember to name a few.
### Adept learner
I'm passionate about continuous improvement and enjoy pushing myself to new heights.
### Programming
Proficient in Python with experience using MATLAB, Rust, Excel VB and JavaScript
### Computer-Aided Design
Fluent using various CAD software namely Fusion, AutoCAD, SketchUp, Ansys and Blender
### Structural Analysis
Experienced utilising various structural analysis software such as SkyCiv S3D & API, Advance Design, Fusion, Ansys and OpenSees. Recently ventured with my own programming knowledge to develop my own 3D Frame analysis tool in Python.
### Communication
Researching, disseminating information and writing project reports requires strong clear communication skills. Throughout my degree I frequently wrote reports based on study and/or my own experimental results. I additionally took part in an online academy to help me develop my skills and become more confident when presenting to large crowds.
