## 🌱 CPD
- Study of [Rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for developing a [finite stiffness method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_stiffness_method#:~:text=The%20direct%20stiffness%20method%20is,elements%20interconnected%20at%20the%20nodes.) solver for use in the LEV3L Roof web application. This will allow users to define input parameters and automatically generate a preliminary structural report for increased efficiency and accurate quotation. 
- Ongoing study of European Quality and Structural standards
