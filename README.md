## Experience
### Technical Manager, [Lev3l Products](https://lev3l.co.uk/), Feb 24 - Present
- Co-founder of a new company with the vision of designing innovative, intuitive, and safe products for the construction industry. 
- Development and maintenance of aluminium truss technical information.
- Custom hanging bracket design, analysis and testing for hanging scaffolding from the underside of a bridge. 
- Relationship building with Suppliers across the world and creation of supply-chain cost analysis tool. 
### Graduate Engineer, [Altrad DESSA](https://www.altrad-dessa.com/), Oct 22 - Feb 24
- Led the development of structural calculations for a new roofing system for the events industry. Advanced my knowledge of aluminium and steel truss design.
- Created and implemented technical report templates following attendance of a course delivered by the IMechE.
- Travelled to the UAE to deliver a technical presentation teaching a group of engineers the structural analysis of temporary roofs and AutoCAD dynamic block creation. 
### Final Year Project, Sep 21 - May 22
- Titled ‚ÄúCompressive behaviour of 3D printed thermoplastic polyurethane lattices for Athletic midsoles‚Äù. 
- Learnt to research effectively, compress information, solve problems, and present my findings in front of an audience. 
- Use of Ansys APDL to model and simulate complex additively manufactured geometries. 
- Use of 3D printer and physical testing to validate my analysis model. 
### Computer-aided Design Technician, Daitob, Sep 21 - Apr 22
- Designed bespoke oak Orangeries using Fusion software to create concise engineering drawings for use on-site. 
- Generation of accurate parts lists for quotation and stock maintenance. 
### Engineering You're Hired! Feb 21
- Collaborated remotely with a multidisciplinary team to design a solution for electric air travel. 
- Together my team decided to focus on the fright sector. We developed ideas for autonomous airships that work in swarms to achieve low-emission transit. 
- Translated ideas into CAD & FEA software where we inspected our design's capability to operate during bad weather. 
- Presented our ideas with relevant research to a board of experts working within the sector, listened to their feedback and answered any questions.
### Global Engineering Challenge, Jan 20
- Worked in a multinational multidisciplinary team to design a solution to limited water supply in Maker‚Äôs Valley, Johannesburg.
- Initially, we identified stakeholders and researched the root of the problem. 
- Together we recognised that the main issue was that underground water pipes would frequently leak. We developed a system that would detect leaks by measuring the flow rates at each end of the pipes.
